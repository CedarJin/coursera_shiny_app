This is a documentation for this shiny app.
This shiny app allows the users to explore the linear relationship using plots generated in the shiny app.
On the sidebar, the users can input the title of their analysis, which would show up on the first row of the main panel.
Follwing the title of the analysis, the users can select if they want to see the data structure and if they want the y variable to be log tranformed.

The users can define the number of observations they want to view on the mian panel as well on the sidebar.

A help text indicates that the users do not need to define the y variable since the y variable is set to miles per gallon as default.

The users can select the x variable that they want to display on the main panel.

On the main panel, they can find the plot showing a fitted linear regression line and all the original data points.

All changes will be valid only when the users click the "update view" botton.
